Reference files that describe echelle spectrograph characteristics.
Used by idl/simobs_one.pro, which creates simulated observations.
simobs.pro looks for echelle reference files in $GRAND_IREFDIR/ech
The nominal value of $GRAND_IREFDIR is $GRAND/iref

Echelle reference files are named <ech>.<type> where:
  <ech>  is the name of the echelle:
    'hires' - Keck HIRES echelle with the new detectors
  <type> is the type of reference data:
    'wave'  - Nominal wavelength solution
    'norm'  - Nominal order response (a.k.a. blaze) function
