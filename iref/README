This directory contains reference files used by IDL routines that are part
of the grand solution code base. IDL code is used to create simulated
observations and to assess output from 'grand'.

Set the environment variable $GRAND_IREFDIR to point at this directory.
IDL code should use this environment variable to locate reference data.

Subdirectories with reference data used by simobs_one.pro and simobs_set.pro:
  'ech'  - echelle spectrograph reference files, e.g., wavelengths
  'elsf' - effective line spread functions
  'iod'  - FTS scans of iodine cells
