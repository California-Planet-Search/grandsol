This directory contains grand solution software, which deduces stellar
parameters by fitting stellar spectra obtained with an iodine cell.

The fitting code 'grandsol/fort/grand' determines:
  intrinsic stellar spectrum (a.k.a. deconvolved template)
  stellar radial velocity for each epoch
  wavelength solutions for each epoch
  crude continuum normalization for each epoch
  line spread functions across the echelle format for each epoch

Brief descriptions of 'grandsol' subdirectories:
  'fort' - fortran source code for the fitting code 'grand.F'
  'gref' - reference files used by the fitting code 'grand'

See README files in each subdirectory for more information.
